# Discord-Username-Sniper
The Discord Username Sniper is a script that demonstrates how to generate a random 3-letter name and update a Discord username using the Discord API. It provides the ability to send webhook notifications upon successful or failed username snipes. The project is organized into multiple files for better modularity and maintainability.
